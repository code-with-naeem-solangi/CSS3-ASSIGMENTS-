    <h1>From Garden to plates</h1>
    <p>A <i>potager</i> is a French term for an omamental vegertable or kitchen gaden.Often flowersn(edible and non-edible)
    and herbs are planted with the vegertable to enhance the garden<sub>,</sub>s beauty. The goal is to make the function 
    of providing food aesthetically pleasing.</p>
    <h2>What to Plant</h2>
    <p>Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and form.Many are trained to grow upward.A 
    well-designed potager can provide food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potagers can disguise
    their function of providing for a home in a wide array of forms-from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the 
    formality of a knot garden.</p>
