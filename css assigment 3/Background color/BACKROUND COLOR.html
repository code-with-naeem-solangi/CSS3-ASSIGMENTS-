    <p class="pragraph">Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials from
        Earths crusl as well as materials released from organisms. The most important 
        components of seawater that infiuence life forms are salinity,temperature, dissolved
        gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These 
        elements vary in their composition as well as in their influence on marine life.
